However, traditional RVs and travel trailers come with a set of problems, including insufficient energy storage, outdated technology and design, poor towing experience, high fuel costs, constant maintenance and safety issues. As the national conversation shifts towards renewable energy and younger generations pledge to make more eco-friendly choices, there is a rising demand for an RV that is sustainable, user-friendly, and supports the growing work-from-anywhere generation.",

I loved the feeling of freedom, but I hated the product experience. There are bumps in every part of the journey that you have to overcome in order to access the good part of RVing — freedom. That’s why I’m building Pebble — an entirely new way to work, live, explore, and experience life on the road. We will use technology to strip away these hassles so that more people will feel comfortable RVing and our customers can focus on the magic of the RVing experience: exploring, relaxing, and making memories.",
